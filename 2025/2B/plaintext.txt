for the attention of general dodge mr dodge, while i cannot claim to have recovered
fully from the rigours of my journey, i have now adjusted to your climate and have begun 
to establish my routine. i hope you will not take it badly that i am reluctant to agree to 
your request to expedite my visit to washington, but i am no longer a young man, and my
performances require considerable energy from me. age is the thief of time, and none of us 
know how quickly it is stolen from us. i must do what i can to martial that most precious resource
. our mutual friend, mr babbage, has commended you to me, and our own prime minister has taken pains 
to explain to me the importance of your mission, however i fail to see how rearranging my schedule
will do anything much to speed the progress of what must necessarily be a long-term investment of 
capital and resources. i have promised that i will do what i can to assist you, but i must consider
my own health and welfare if i am to complete this tour. may i also remark that if the work on which
you are embarked is truly as secret as you and babbage seem to believe, then the use of ancient ciphers
does not meet that need. i have taken the liberty of using something a little more appropriate in this
letter and would suggest that perhaps we use this method for our future communications. 
yours sincerely, charles dickens

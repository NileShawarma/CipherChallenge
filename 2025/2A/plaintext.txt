my dear grenville,

i must apologise for charles, he is a good man, but can be irascible, and travel 
really does not suit him. i read his letter to you with some concern (thank you for sending me a copy),
seeing that it demonstrates a lowness in his spirts, but i can assure you that he intends only the best for
our endeavour. it took the combined efforts of myself and lord derby to convince him of the rightness of our plan,
but while he is fully committed to our cause, he is not entirely at ease with our methods. i have continued to
solicit support for your proposal on this side of the atlantic, and i am confident that my own small contribution 
can play an important part in its success. i trust that your group remains confident that it can deliver on its promise.
with the support of the british and american governments i think we could build something entirely new and extremely
powerful, however the true potential can only be met if we can ensure total secrecy, and i will have to rely on you to 
persuade charles not to speak of our designs with anyone outside of our circle. for his own part, charles is chiefly interested 
in the success of his tour, and while he will play an important role in persuading investors to join our scheme and politicians 
to support it, it is important that he is also able to enjoy the fruits of his reading performances. he invests much of himself in
those readings and is inclined to overtire himself. i trust that you and your friends will offer him the support that i would offer 
if i could be there with him. without that support i fear that he will have no energy left to promote our project.

your friend, charles babbage
